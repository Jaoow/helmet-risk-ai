Welcome to the **Health Risk AI** repository! 🚀

This is a **Data Science and Machine Learning** project developed to predict health habits (alcohol consumption and smoking) based on clinical exams and body measurements. The goal is to demonstrate how Artificial Intelligence can assist in identifying risk profiles quickly and intuitively.

## 🎯 What does this project do?

The application works as a screening tool. It receives patient data (such as age, weight, cholesterol, blood tests) and uses Artificial Intelligence models to answer two main questions:

1. 🍺 **Does this person have a tendency to consume alcohol?** (Yes/No)
2. 🚬 **What is the smoking profile?** (Non-smoker / Ex-smoker / Active Smoker)

All presented through a modern, interactive, and user-friendly web interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project was built 100% in Python, using the following libraries:

* **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):** For tabular data manipulation and structuring.
* **[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/):** The heart of the AI. Used to create, train, and validate Machine Learning models (Random Forest).
* **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/):** Amazing framework to turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.
* **[Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/):** Essential for saving trained models (`.pkl`) and loading them instantly in the app.
* **[Numpy](https://numpy.org/):** For mathematical calculations and array support.

## 🧠 How was the AI built?

The "brain" of this project was trained with a real dataset containing thousands of health exam records. The development pipeline followed these steps:

1. **Training (Google Colab):**
   * **Cleaning:** Handling null values and inconsistent data.
   * **Leakage Prevention:** Removal of columns that could give away the answer to the model (*data leakage*).
   * **Modeling:** Training a **Random Forest Classifier** algorithm, chosen for its robustness and high accuracy on tabular data.

2. **Application (Local):**
   * Exporting trained models to `.pkl` files.
   * Developing the Frontend with Streamlit for real-time model consumption.

## 🚀 How to run the project on your machine

Follow the steps below to test the project on your own computer:

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine.

### 2. File Structure
The project has the following structure:

```
health-ia/
├── app.py                    # Streamlit Application
├── requirements.txt          # Project Dependencies
├── README.md                # This file
└── model_data/              # Directory with trained models
    ├── scaler.pkl           # Data normalizer
    ├── modelo_alcool.pkl    # Alcohol prediction model
    └── modelo_fumo.pkl      # Smoking prediction model
```

### 3. Installing Dependencies

Open your terminal in the project folder and install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install streamlit scikit-learn joblib pandas numpy
```

### 4. Run the App

## 🎨 Application Interface

The Streamlit interface has:

- **Sidebar:** Information about the model and medical disclaimer
- **Interactive Form:** Fields organized by category for clinical data entry
- **Results Panel:** Clear display of alcohol and smoking predictions with intuitive colors and icons

---

## 📈 Model Accuracy

The models were trained with **Random Forest Classifier** algorithm and present:

* **Approximate Accuracy:** ~99% (on synthetic tests)
* **Most Important Variables:** Gamma GTP, age, hemoglobin, HDL cholesterol
